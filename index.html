<h1> Argue 2 advantages of Git DVCS over Dropbox</h1>
<p> 
git and dropbox both use cloud technology and both can be used to create and store different versions of files but in a very distinguis way.
</p>
<p>
Git allow you to keep track of your work by offering an annotated and controlled history of your project.
It is true that Dropbox is simple to use, and you don’t need a lot thinking while using. But It is not easy to revert on something that you think need to be changed.
</p>
<p>
It is easier to track bugs in git than in Dropbox since you can focus on the commit that you are suspecting rather than revising everything without precision.
